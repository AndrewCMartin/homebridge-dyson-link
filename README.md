# homebridge-dyson-link

## Introduction
This is just a hobby project as I just bought my Dyson Link device and would like to use Siri and Home App to control that. I decided to share here just in case if this can be somewhat useful to others, that will be great. :)

## Installation

npm install -g homebridge-dyson-link

## Configuration

See config-sample.json for example
We will need to input the IP, display name, serial number and password to the config
